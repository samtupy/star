This provider makes the Google Cloud text to speech voices available to STAR.

To use, first `pip install google-cloud-texttospeech` and then run googlecloud.py --configure to set your Google API key.

Pitch and Rate do work and are both multiples setting the rate to 2 will double the default speed, for example.
