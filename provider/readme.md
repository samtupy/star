# Provider

This directory contains various voice providers which allow you to use any voice on STAR from those provided by cloud services like Amazon, Google or ElevenLabs to local voices such as SAPI, MacOS AVSpeech and more.

Each provider contains a small readme document with a description and any critical notes, they'll be updated over time with more detail.

The provider.py file is a backend written in Python which makes adding most new providers a very simple task, and is the root of most providers in this repository. For more information about providers in general or to learn how to write one, see the project's main readme file.
